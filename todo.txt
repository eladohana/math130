3. Create moving object
--DONE  * This should be a class for any moving object
--DONE  * the object should take speed, angle into account
-- Done:  * there should be functions to figure out how much movement there should be on the x and y axis based on trigonometry (sin/cos)
-- Done: * Object should be able to rotate
  * anything else?

4. Create projectile
DONE --  * this should be an extension of the moving object class
DONE --   * the projectile will be a small circle
DONE -- * the projectile should check for collisions
    -- Maybe these are better in the game class?
DONE  * the projectile should bounce off other objects
    -- maybe same here?
  * other stuff?

5. Create Ship
DONE --  * the ship is also an extension of the movingObject class
DONE --   * the ship should be made of lines and filled in with a color
DONE  * the ship will check for collisions with other items
DONE  * the ship should be able to create a projectile at the angle it's moving
  * other stuff?
